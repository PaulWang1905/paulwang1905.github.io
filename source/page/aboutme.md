# Short Bio

Born in the 1990s in a small county in Henan, I began my academic journey in 2014 by enrolling in the Musicology program at Zhengzhou Normal University. In 2019, I pursued a Master of Arts degree at Shanghai Normal University, where my research focused on the performance practice of 18th-century concertos, particularly exploring solo parts, orchestral accompaniment, and improvisational elements such as cadenzas. During a lockdown lasting about three month, I graduated in May 2022 without a formal ceremony.

Later in 2022, I transitioned to the University of Oxford to pursue a PhD in Engineering Science. While I have a strong background in music—playing the double bass, guitar, and some piano—my interest in coding and Linux has developed as a personal hobby. My initial focus was helping computers understand the structure of music and even generate it.

Now, I am working on semantic web technologies, Linked Open Data, and their applications in music and cultural heritage, with proficiency in CIDOC CRM.
