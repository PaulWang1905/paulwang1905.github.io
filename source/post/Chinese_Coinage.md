# Chinese Coinage
Recently I have been reading this book [《中国货币史》](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E8%B4%A7%E5%B8%81%E5%8F%B2_%E6%A0%A1%E8%AE%A2%E7%89%88/BBNZEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) to understand Chinese Coinage for my PhD work -- creating numismatic knowledge model for Chinese Coins. 
I will keep some note here for reference.
