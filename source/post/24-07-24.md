# Note for 24-07-24
## Recent thought on who I am
Am I a Kantian? If I am, what kind of Kantian am I? I cannot claim to be knowledgeable about Kantian philosophy. 
However, I truely believe that it is, by default, the duty of human to do good things. 
Yet, I do not have confidence in the autonomy of individuals. 
My skepticism arises from the fact that I often find people are not truly free.
